1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: Over the past few months, my programming skills have improved significantly. I've become more proficient in using data structures, such as arrays and linked lists, to solve complex problems. Additionally, my understanding of algorithmic efficiency has improved, allowing me to write more optimized and scalable code.
2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills: While I've made strides in front-end development, I recognize the need to enhance my skills in backend technologies. Specifically, I plan to focus on for loops and server side development.
4. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast: The hands-on labs have played a pivotal role in solidifying my understanding of programming concepts. I now approach them with confidence, having gained proficiency in areas such as debugging, code optimization, and collaborative coding practices.
5. The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence: The labs have help me learned and be confident in my coding. It has helped me with my assignment 1 and understand why I need this in my code and what it does. It gives me an understanding of what to add in my assignments.
6. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2: I learned a lot from assignment 1. It pushed me to delve deeper into software design principles and project organization. The challenges I encountered have equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to confidently tackle the more complex Assignment 2 
7. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways: Include real world applications would be beneficial in the lectures. Also, providing more opportunities for collaborative projects and practical exercises could further reinforce theoretical concepts and better prepare students for real-world scenarios.
8. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.): The labs, Discord chat, screencasts, help from classmates,and one on one help has helped me the most in class.
