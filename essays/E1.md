Starting BrowserHistory1 a bit easy. I had to look back at the screencast solutions a couple of times because I wanted to make sure if I wasn't missing anything. I also had to look back at W3 schools and other resources to help me complete this WOD. I think BrowserHistory1 video went over 15 minutes but I just submit it anyways because each time I record, I always forget something in the video and had to go back to the solutions a couple of times. To film the video, I used Zoom. I think it was easy to film through Zoom because I wasn't familar with the Apps that Prof. Port recomended. 

My Advice for the WODs is to watch the screencast first before attempting and  look at sources to know how to do the task. Also, don't give up!
