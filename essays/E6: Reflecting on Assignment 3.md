2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?: I had problems with my invoice, login/registration, and some parts of the session.

2. Describe what you are most proud of about your system: I am proud of my nav bar. Even though it's just a simple nav bar, it was tough for me to implement it onto my page.

4. Describe what you are least happy with your system: I am least happy with my invoice.html. I wish I had the time to fix that.

6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?: I try to see if I misspelled anything and if it is severe, I use the debugger if it works. And if nothing works, I either restart everything or ask prof for help.

8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?: I had trouble with IR1. It was difficult for me
