Starting WOD1 was kind of intimidating to me. The amount of instructions on WOD1 made me think that I wouldn't get through it but it is worth the try. Before recording BrowserHistory1, I attempted the task first so that I know what I am doing. It took me a few attempts to complete BrowserHistory1 but I did manage to record everything that the task to me to do. For the recording part, I wasn't sure what apps to use to record the WODs so I used Zoom to record it. I managed to record all the BrowserHistory task under 15 minutes. There were times where I went over because I forgot what I was doing but I found a solution to that problem. I made a bullet point list to remember the instructions to complete WOD1.
