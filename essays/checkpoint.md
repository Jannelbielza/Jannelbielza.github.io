1. Here is my presentation: https://youtu.be/Hq2VrCKB7A0

2. Describe your design for your siteâ€™s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart: For the shopping cart, I plan to intregrate into the product page. It will be on the left side of the page where users can change their quantities or remove the product from the cart. Additionally, I might add the total at the end of the shopping cart and as well as the checkout page.

3. Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session: I will implement the sessions variable to store the cart data. The cart data needs to be stored as an array of objects in the session. Each of the objects will represent the product that the user added into the cart with the other properties as well. 

4. How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?: To prevent access to my application when the user has not logged in or registered, users must loggin/register when viewing their invoice. 

5. Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary): After a successful login, I will display the users username for the users experience. Ex. (Thank you Jannel for purchasing our products!)

6. If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when? I will not work with a partner. It's a solo project for meeee.

7. How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?: I will be using more of the cookie lab for this assignment. I will also fix the errors/issues that I created on assignment 2.
