When I was a student in high school, I always tell people that I wanted to become a software engineer and work at a big tech company at Silicon Valley. I was fixated to overcome that dream one day so I took an AP Computer Science course. The first coding language I learned was Javascript and it was tough for me. First, I thought coding was very easy because I used to watch a lot of YouTube videos of people coding. Taking a course in Javascript really humbled me becuase of the amount of bugs I had to fix on my homework assignment. However, I didn't gave up on coding and I really enjoyed the challeneges of writing a program. Taking a course in computer science in high school made me want to major in computer science when I entered college.

As my first year of college comes around, I began my studies in B.S. of Computer Science. I was really excited to step into the path of my dream career to become a software engineer. The first computer science course I took at UH was ICS 111. I didn't know what to expect but I remember I was excited to take this course and I thought it would be a bit easier since I had some experience in coding. The beginning of the course, I remembered the first assignment was to write "hello world!" Throughout the semester of this course, the assignments got way harder and difficult to understand. Also this happened during the pandemic, I didn't know anyone that's taking that course. I remember staying up till 3 AM just to finish an assignment. The work got increasingly hard for me that I made the decision to change my major to MIS. 

I changed my major to MIS because I also had an interest in learning about business and I didn't want to give up on learning coding. I still have a passion for tech, creativity, and finding solutions so that's why I majored in MIS.
