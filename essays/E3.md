Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to the WOD page for further details (from Dr. Port's GitHub repository):

https://jannelbielza.github.io/ITM352_F23_repo//WODs/SmartPhoneProducts1_variables/products_display.html

For this WOD, the instruction was to remove any hard coding by using RegEx and deleting any tags. Then we had to create a javascript file to put all of the variables of the products data. Then we had to create a console.log to vertify if the products are loading.

Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down?:

What worked well of this WOD is the RegEx part. Im starting to get the hang of it and it's very convenient. I stumbled on finding if the console.log for the products showed up.

Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WODs before this?

Like the other WODs, I read the instructions before attempting it and also experimented with the instructions. 

Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.

I could've read the instructions and the screencast videos a couple of times before filming for the WOD.
