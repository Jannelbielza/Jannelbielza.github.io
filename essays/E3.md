**Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to the WOD page for further details (from Dr. Port's GitHub repository):**

This WOD (Workout of the Day) focused on enhancing product display functionality by eliminating hard-coded data, using RegEx to streamline content, and organizing data in a JavaScript file. 

**Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down?:**

I found the RegEx implementation particularly effective; itâ€™s becoming easier to use, and I appreciate how it simplifies the code. However, I faced some challenges in verifying the console.log output for the product data, which slowed my progress.

**Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WODs before this?**

As with previous WODs, I reviewed the instructions carefully and experimented with the steps beforehand. This process of preliminary exploration helped clarify the tasks before starting.

** Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD. **

To better prepare, I could re-watch the screencast videos and review the instructions multiple times before beginning the WOD. This might help me anticipate potential issues and streamline my approach.
