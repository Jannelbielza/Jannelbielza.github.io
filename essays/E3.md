This WOD is [Invoice 1]([https://pages.github.com/](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html).

Before creating this essay, I completed the Invoice1 WOD. In this WOD, I had to create a sales receipt for a sale that contains 5 products. I had to use expression and variables to compute the values correctly.

My experience with Invoice1 was a challenging one. Before filming on Zoom, I attempted the WOD so that I knew what I am doing. If I stumbled on a question, I check back on the solution video that is provided on the bottom of the page and attempt what professor was showing. The difficult part of this WOD was putting the javascript variables onto the HTML tags. There was one part where I accidentally used the quotation tags instead of the back quotes. Adding the comments was very helpful because it helps me remember what is this code for. What I could done differently for the next WOD is to take advantage using the REGEX tool to make things a bit faster and efficient.
